# [Burger Shack](https://burger-shack.vercel.app/)

## Abstract
Burger Shack is a React application designed to mimic a food ordering platform, where users can easily place orders. The app showcases a variety of menu items for users to choose from and incorporates multiple features for enhanced user experience. Users have the flexibility to add specific quantities of items to their orders, remove items as needed, and submit the order to reset the process.

The application consists of several pages, with React Router facilitating smooth navigation between them. These pages include a comprehensive menu item overview providing detailed information, a summary page displaying the user's order details, and a checkout page for finalizing the order.
